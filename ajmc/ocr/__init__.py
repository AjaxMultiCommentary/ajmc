"""
``ajmc.ocr`` is a package for optical character recognition (OCR) of historical documents. It is very work-in-progress and is not meant to be used \
as a library yet. Methods, classes and functions are subject to change at any time and are mainly implemented around experiments (notably in \
``ocr.pytorch`` and ``ocr.tesseract``).
