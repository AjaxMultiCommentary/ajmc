"""
``ajmc.olr`` is a package for optical layout recognition (OLR) of historical documents. It is very work-in-progress and is not meant to be used \
as a library yet. Methods, classes and functions are subject to change at any time and are mainly implemented around **experiments** (notably in \
``olr.layoutlm`` and ``olr.yolo``).
