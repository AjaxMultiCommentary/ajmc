    "## Why should one bother creating `CanonicalCommentary`s ? \n",
    "\n",
    "- TL;DR : Skip to the next section üëáüèº\n",
    "\n",
    "### The vagaries of OCR\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask yourself: what's actually the problem with `OcrCommentary`s ? Why should we care about enhancing an `OcrCommentary` in the first place ? Well, the problem is not really about the object itself but on the many inconsistencies and noise of the OCR outputs it relies on. To cite a few:\n",
    "    1. Empty or non words\n",
    "    2. Crummy, elongated, stretched or shrinked word bounding boxes or even inverted bounding boxes with negative width and height (True story).\n",
    "    3. Labyrinthine reading order\n",
    "    4. Single lines spanning over multiple columns, multiple lines or side numbers\n",
    "    5. Diacritics recognized as single lines\n",
    "    6. Crummy, elongated, stretched or shrinked line bounding boxes\n",
    "    7. ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The weakness of xml formats\n",
    "\n",
    "To add to this already long though not exhaustive list of pitfalls, one should add two other caveats:\n",
    "- OCR outputs come in different formats (Kraken or Tesseract style `hocr`, `alto`, `pagexml`...)\n",
    "- Though very different because of their individualistic wills to create [harmonized, overarching standards](https://xkcd.com/927/), these formats all share the same weakness: the nested architecture of xml-like documents. Let me provided with a simple example. Say we have the following page :\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<xml_page attribute_1=\"...\" attribute_2=\"...\">\n",
    "    <xml_line attribute_1=\"...\" attribute_2=\"...\">\n",
    "        <xml_word attribute_1=\"...\" attribute_2=\"...\">Foo</xml_word>\n",
    "        <xml_word attribute_1=\"...\" attribute_2=\"...\">Bar</xml_word>\n",
    "    </xml_line>\n",
    "    <xml_line attribute_1=\"...\" attribute_2=\"...\">\n",
    "        <xml_word attribute_1=\"...\" attribute_2=\"...\">Zig</xml_word>\n",
    "        <xml_word attribute_1=\"...\" attribute_2=\"...\">Zag</xml_word>\n",
    "    </xml_line>\n",
    "</xml_page>\n",
    "```\n",
    "In `xml_page` we have two `xml_line` elements, which themselves contain two `xml_word` elements. If this is already a pain to navigate through, the most vicious issue is still to come. It appears when you try to overlap different layers of text containers. Say you have a region spanning only the n first word of a line. Should your region be a child of the line ? This makes no sense from a global perspective: regions (such as paragraphs) are higher in the hierarchy and should be parent to lines. One could be tempted to create a line for the region, but then an other problem arises: when calling all the lines from a page, should one call the lines from the regions or from the lines directly, as they are now different ? If you think this is complicated enough, let me give another trivial example : what about entities (e.g. named entities) that span over multiple pages. For instance, say we have an entity starting with the two last words of the last line of page n and ends with the first word of the main text of page n+1. Retrieve the words in such an entity demands extrem precision and ridiculously complex chunks of code. In pseudo-python, you would end up with something like `my_entity.words = pages[n].children.lines[-1].children.words[-2:]+page[n+1].children.lines[0].children.words[0]`. And this is even yet a simple case.  What if you have a footnote on page n that you don't want to include ? What if the first line of page n+1 is actually the page number and not the main text ? I let you imagine the kind of recondite code you end up with (`my_entity.words = pages[n].children.find_all(\"regions\", type=\"main_text\")[-1].children.lines[-1].words[-2:]+pages[n+1] ... my_pain.end()`. Not even mentionning the fact that this code is not yet dynamic and that a simple change in page numbering, word alignment or region reading order completely ruins the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The advantages of the canonical format\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle these issues, we come up with a fairly simple canonical format to store our data. Its philosophy and implementation is strikingly easy to fathom: go horizontal ! Instead of having nested and re-nested text containers we collect a global list of words and map every other text container to a word range. And that pretty much it. Here's an example\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"words\" : [{\"text\":\"Foo\", \"attribute_1\":\"...\", \"attribute_2\":\"...\"},\n",
    "             {\"text\":\"Bar\", \"attribute_1\": \"...\", \"attribute_2\":\"...\"},\n",
    "             {\"text\":\"Zig\", \"attribute_1\": \"...\", \"attribute_2\":\"...\"},\n",
    "             {\"text\":\"Zag\", \"attribute_1\": \"...\", \"attribute_2\":\"...\"}],\n",
    "  \"pages\": [{\"word_range\": [0,3]}],\n",
    "  \"lines\": [{\"word_range\": [0,1]},\n",
    "            {\"word_range\": [2,3]}]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This format comes with a lot of advantages :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It's a `json`, not an xml. It's easily readable both by humans and machines. You can import it in 2 lines of code and then, well, it's a python `dict`. No weird `bs4` or `etree` objects. They are completely overkill for our purpose and offer nothing that `json`s or `dict`s can't do.\n",
    "2. It solves the nesting and overlapping problem at once. You can have overlapping, nested, renested textcontainers. Important thing is that they can be accessed **horizontally**, simply by finding the other textcontainers with an included or overlapping word range. Same to get a textcontainer's words : simply call `my_tc.words = words[*my_tc.word_range]`.\n",
    "3. It makes redundant information of xmls useless: To get a line's bounding box, you simply concatenate it's words bounding box. This allows to store an entire 400 pages commentary in a ~35MB file, as opposed to ~85MB other OCR outputs (with no information loss and no optimisation on my side), which transitions well to the next point.\n",
    "4.  It is computationnaly efficient. See a simple example here :"
